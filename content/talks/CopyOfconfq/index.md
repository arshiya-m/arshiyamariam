abstract: Cancer survivors are considered at increased risk of developing new primary cancers. The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program monograph reports that about 10% of cancer survivors in the USA were diagnosed with a second or higher-order primary cancers. This paper uses new data science approaches to better understand associations and identify patterns of multiple cancer sites. We analyzed data from SEER program registries during a 42-year period 1973 to 2015 for 688,892 patients with multiple primary cancers (MPCs). Machine-learning algorithms including association rule mining, network analysis, and page rank were used to report patterns of MPCs.
