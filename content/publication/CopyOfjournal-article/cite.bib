      rectal cancers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversial data exists in the current literature in regard to the use 
      of neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) in patients with clinical T3N0 (cT3N0) rectal 
      cancers, specifically based on location and relation to peritoneal reflection. We 
      aimed to analyze the impact of nCRT on oncologic outcomes among cT3N0 rectal 
      cancers, depending on the tumor height from anal verge (AV). METHODS: A 
      retrospective analysis of patients with cT3N0 rectal cancers was included from a 
      query of a prospectively maintained rectal cancer database from 1980 to 2016. 
      Patients were divided into 3 groups based on the tumor height: low (1-5 cm from AV), 
      mid (6-10 cm from AV), and upper (11-15 cm from AV). Patients were stratified by use 
      of nCRT. MAIN OUTCOMES: 5-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), 
      cancer-specific survival (CSS), and local recurrence (LR) using Kaplan-Meier curves. 
      RESULTS: Five hundred ninety-two patients were included. Overall, 364 (61.4%) 
      patients received nCRT and 228 (38.6%) patients did not. There were 251 (43%) 
      patients with low, 302 (51%) with mid, and 39 (7%) with upper rectal cancer. 
      Patients with low and mid rectal cancers received nCRT more frequently than those 
      with upper rectal cancers (68.5% and 61.2% vs 43.6%, p = 0.007). The 5-year OS was 
      78% and 63%, DFS-88% and 73%, LR-1% and 8% in nCRT followed by resection vs. surgery 
      alone (p < 0.001). In regard to cancer location after nCRT compared with surgery 
      alone, low and mid cancers had better OS, DFS, and CSS, compared with upper ones. 
      CONCLUSION: nCRT prolongs survival among patients with rectal cancer below 10 cm 
      from AV; however, it has no effect on 5-year oncologic survival of patients with 
      upper rectal cancer located below peritoneal reflection.
